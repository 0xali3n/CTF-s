About Lame

* Found it is using ftp vsftpd 2.3.4 -> searched in google got a famous backdoor exploit. But didn't work for this website.
* Then found it is using Samba 3.0.20 -> Search in google got CVE-2007-2447 Samba "username map script" Command Execution.

**Description**

This module exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3 when using the non-default "username map script" configuration option. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability since this option is used to map usernames prior to authentication!
